Desperately you kick out at the beast with your other foot catching it on the muzzle and it releases you long enough to complete your escape. You drop head first to the ground and land in an ungainly heap, slowly rising to your feet rubbing your head and looking around.

Watching you in some amazement are a number of towns folk, gathering about you as one over friendly lady dusts you down before catching a glimpse of your face and starting back with a gasp. She turns and mutters to her neighbours and the mood of the mob quickly turns sour.

There is some hustle and then some bustle and the crowd slowly parts, a scrappy girl with a face like thunder careens out of the mob wielding a shoe above her head - Whack! - she clobbered you about the head with it! Lifting your arms to defend your face you steady yourself for another blow when a growling male voice shouts "Oubliette, Oubliette! What do you think you are doing, stop that at once! You must never beat a stranger with a shoe, you might as well tickle them, always use a good sturdy leather boot.". With that he passes her the sturdiest, leatheriest boot you've ever seen. A quick weigh of the boot, hefted from hand to hand and the girl is ready, just enough time for you catch a whiff of the well made boot before you catch it full in the face and everything goes black.

You wake up some hours later, it must be late afternoon by the waning warmth of the sun, with a throbbing head ache and a mouth as dry as a sesame cracker. Sitting propped up against a wall, your hands tied behind your back, you wriggle your wrists looking for any give in the rope to no avail. Looking about you see Oubliette standing close by, watching you with a smaller girl waiting excitedly next to her.

item successful use message:Placing the hollow trunk so that it connects the slide by your feet to a ramp that extends over the ruin walls you stand back and wait. Nothing occurs, the creature does not venture forth. You jump up and down shouting then suddenly you see movement at the top of the tower. A deep growling, a whoosh of air and the barrelling goon shoots out of the tower down the ramp towards your feet at a breakneck pace hurtling into the hollow section of tree trunk and out onto the connected ramp. A short squeal of surprise and the creature is launched over the castle walls, a bundle of fur flying through the air, leaving the courtyard unguarded and free for foragers to reap the mushroomy rewards within.

There is a tower in one corner that has been more resistant to the relentless encroachment of vegetation and from it seems to be a slide that has been purposely built or fashioned by repeated use. It is made of worn bricks and leads from the top of the tower to close by your feet. You can see some fungi interspersed through the ruins.

item can be used with:pocket_mushrooms
item successful use message:You pass the mushroom plucker and the mushrooms you have gathered to Oubliette. Placing them in her woven basket she picks one out and passes it to you. "Here, have this for your trouble, I know it's not much but it might come in handy. These mushrooms will heal if eaten, but take care not to each too much as you will fall asleep and appear to others as though dead.". She turns away to leave but hesitates - "I also found this amongst the rocks" nodding towards one of the barrelling goon's slides as she passes you a charred bone. You take it cautiously, noting the spiralling runes carved into the surface. "It's weird, goons don't usually come this close to town, maybe this has something to do with it." she shrugs. "Anyway I'm heading back to town, you know the way - thanks again!" and off she goes without glancing back. You stand alone in the courtyard shuffling your shoes and decide to head back to town with her.
