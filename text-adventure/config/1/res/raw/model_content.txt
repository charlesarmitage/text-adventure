You look at the thing but you still can't distinguish any of its features. "Ok, a scapula was it, some sort of physician are you?". You nod cautiously. "Great, well if you pop down to the kitchen you'll find a loose flagstone, move it out of the way and you can get down to the cellar beneath the kitchen.

item name:Burly Brigand
item description:The brigand looks fierce and unfriendly, not surprising really. He glares at you, as though wishing you'd step a little closer so he can hack off your head and kick you in the crotch. He's a meany.

item talk initial phrase:hello:Hello!:You say "Hello!".
item talk response to:hello:The brigand growls menacingly and steps forward just a little.
item talk follow up phrase to:hello:idontwanttrouble:I don't want any trouble...:You say "Hey, wait a minute, I don't want any trouble... I'm just trying to recover some potentially stolen goods and wondered if you knew where I might look?"
item talk response to:idontwanttrouble:The brigand stands a little taller and replies in a slow drawl "What do you mean? Do I look like I'd know where stolen goods would be?". He playfully scrapes the blade of his sword over the stone floor and looks at you thoughtfully. You fully expect those thoughts to be mostly about stabbing you with that sword.
item talk follow up phrase to:idontwanttrouble:ivemadeamistake:Sorry I've made a mistake...:You quickly reply "I've made a mistake, my apologies good sir - you are obviously an honourable and decent fellow!"
item talk response to:ivemadeamistake:The brigand says "Yeah, that's right. I am. Now scarper before I come over there and split you from head to heel!"

item talk initial phrase:outofmyway:Out of my way...:You puff your chest up and say in your gruffest voice "Out of my way barbarian or feel the wrath of my sword! He is sharp and eager, yes, be afeared for he is known as Shiny the Dread. Be further warned that in many parts of the land I am known as Dave the Shiv, so stand aside before I am forced to unsheathe Shiny and do you an injury!"
item talk response to:outofmyway:The brigand observes you with mild disdain and you feel your ruse has not worked as well as you had hoped.

item talk follow up phrase to:mygosh:andyourshoeslookauthentic:And your shoes look so authentic...:Steeling yourself for a second gambit you state "And your shoes look so authentic, probably real leather? I wish I had only half your taste and fashion sense.". You gulp in anticipation of the certain head chopping to come.
item talk response to:andyourshoeslookauthentic:"Shoes?" says the brigand furrowing his brow deeply.
item talk follow up phrase to:andyourshoeslookauthentic:yourhairisshiny:Your hair is so shiny...:And now for the killer blow - all or nothing - "Your hair is so shiny - like summer rain, it has such natural elegance, just flowing over your shoulders. Magnificent!"
item talk response to:yourhairisshiny:"Gosh." blubbers the brigand. His voice has raised an octave or two and softened considerably. "That's awfully nice of you to say so, I spent hours this morning trying to get just the right look. Of course no one's been down here all week. I've been here all by myself with that smelly dog and no one to talk to. You're the first person I've had a chance to try out my brigand act on. What do you think, were you scared when you first saw me?" he asks with a wry smile and the hint of a girlish giggle rising in his face.
item talk follow up phrase to:yourhairisshiny:youcouldhavebeenmorefierce:You could have been more fierce...:You say "Well you could have been more fierce but on the whole I'd give you 3 out of 5."
item talk response to:youcouldhavebeenmorefierce:"Oh dear, really? That's a shame, I'd tried so hard." The poor brigand looks decidedly dejected. Positively glum.
item talk follow up phrase to:youcouldhavebeenmorefierce:youwereveryfierce
item talk follow up phrase to:yourhairisshiny:youwereveryfierce:You were very fierce...:You say "Actually I thought you were very fierce and unfriendly, utterly convincing."
item talk response to:youwereveryfierce:"Oh wonderful!" cries the brigand. "I'm so happy I think I'll just let you pass. Between you and me I couldn't stop you if I wanted to, this is just for show, and you've been so sweet.". The brigand literally skips aside, bows and motions you towards the barred door at the rear of the cavern. He whispers at you, covering his mouth as if someone might be listening "If you don't mind I'll keep up the brigand act - a jobbing actor has got to practice you know.". He signals the end of his secret missive with a wink.

item talk response to:iwouldbehonoured:"Wonderful! Now this is in confidence so you mustn't tell a soul - you see I have a friend who is love sick for a young man who toys with her affections, he is very cruel and dallies with other ladies about town. It is so sad as they would be a perfect match both romantically and in terms of status. I have resolved to help her and to that end I have advised that if she gives the young man a draft of my making he will stay faithful to her to the end.". You think this sounds like an excellent idea, after all what can go wrong. "I accept" you say without hesitation. "Ok" Bella continues "I will need some very special ingredients - a mendicants scapula, some of a herb named Silk Blood and an arc stone. The last item can only be found by men with green eyes, as you have, since it requires a little bit of magic inside to recognise it. I cannot help you with the other items but for the arc stone I can cast a small spell over a pick axe if you have one that will allow you to mine the rock seams that contain such precious stone."

On the other side of the desk she sits, deep in concentration bent over a bowl and talking to a mysterious glowing stone. There are voices all around you, muttering incoherent and unrepeatable things, you are very nervous standing here and feel a pressing need to leave and run away.

Staring deeply into the stone she caresses it with one hand, closes her eyes and starts to mumble an incantation. The air is thick with static and you can hear Bella's voice splitting into many dissonant tones echoing all around you. You're starting to feel slightly nervous, you didn't expect quite such a reaction for a simple harmless, love potion!

item talk follow up phrase to:whatishappening:thatdoesntsmelllikealovepotion:That doesn't smell like a love potion:"That doesn't smell like a love potion to me." you reply rather meekly.
item talk response to:thatdoesntsmelllikealovepotion:Bella stands up and strides towards you. "You idiot, I don't need you any more! Of course it's not a love potion, what a ridiculous notion - why would I care about someone's trifling dalliance. This is a death potion!". Of course, you suddenly realise that is what the smell is, it's not love it's the rotting wretchedness of a man's impending doom!
item talk follow up phrase to:thatdoesntsmelllikealovepotion:idontunderstand:I don't understand!:"But why? Who are you making this for? I don't understand!". Again you mumble this rather feebly and with a good dose of self pity. You resolve to be a bit more heroic with your next utterance.
item talk response to:idontunderstand:"Weakling, pitiful fool, you really are an imbecile aren't you?". She pauses for a moment to let her tirade sink in. "This potion is for my dear husband." she sneers. "He's a waste of space too, you are peas in a pod and deserve to be crushed. I'll take his money, his house and his life!". She moves ever more closely into your personal space and you can sense her power. You're feeling really anxious now. She sweeps her arms back and screams "Get out!" swinging down towards you and at once you feel the air contract and blast you through the door. You grasp onto the door frame battling with the force of her magic.

She looks a little puzzled and you return the look of puzzlement with a slight air of surprise - that'll make her think. Slowly she sniffs the air and wiping the icky mess from her face glares at you and cries "What have you done? This is Witches Bane - my one weakness - how did you know?". You stand there and consider answering her question with the obvious reply but decide it is a little pointless now. Her face is starting to contort and she chokes and splutters "Damn you, damn you!". She knocks the bowl to the floor as the deadly herb ravages her evil body, twisting her this way and that. Bella suddenly pulls herself upright and with the last of her strength charges at the door before you realise what is happening. As she runs out she screams at you "This is not over - I'll destroy you for this, one day, I'll destroy you!". And she is gone.<newline><newline>Well done!
